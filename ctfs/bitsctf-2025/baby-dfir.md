# Baby DFIR

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/abc.ad1" %}

Given flag is a .ad1 file wich is a proprietary format generated by tools like FTK Imager.\
\
After some research on how to extract content from those types of files I found that I could use Autopsy with a specific Module from this github:\
[https://github.com/markmckinnon/Autopsy-Plugins/tree/master](https://github.com/markmckinnon/Autopsy-Plugins/tree/master)

Module is : AD1-Extractor

After Downloading the Module, I went creating a Case on Autopsy, I added the AD1-Extract Folder to the Tools -> Python Plugins that opened the python plugins folder.\
I restarted Autopsy, reopened the case and Added the Data Source:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Selecting Logial Files for loading the abc.ad1 file given:\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

After that, The Autopsy program loaded the abc.ad1 file and applied the AD1-Extractor module on it:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We can then see the flag:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
